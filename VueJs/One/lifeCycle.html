<!-- 
Life Cycle Hooks in Vue.js 

Vue.js provides a set of lifecycle hooks that allow you to execute code at specific stages of a component's lifecycle. These hooks give you the ability to perform actions such as initializing data, making API calls, or cleaning up resources.

The main lifecycle hooks in Vue.js are:------

1. beforeCreate: Called before the instance is created. Data and events are not yet set up.


2. created: Called after the instance is created. Data and events are set up, but the DOM is not yet mounted.


3. beforeMount: Called right before the mounting begins. The render function is about to be called for the first time.


4. mounted: Called after the instance has been mounted to the DOM. You can access the DOM elements here.          



5. beforeUpdate: Called when data changes, before the DOM is patched. You can perform actions before the update occurs.


6. updated: Called after the DOM has been updated. You can perform actions after the update occurs.

7. beforeUnmount: Called right before a component instance is unmounted. You can perform cleanup tasks here.

8. unmounted: Called after a component instance has been unmounted. You can perform final cleanup tasks here.
